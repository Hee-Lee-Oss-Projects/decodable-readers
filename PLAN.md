# PLAN — decodable-readers

> Status: Draft · Version: 0.2.0 · Last updated: 2026-06-29 · Owner: J. Carter (acting maintainer) · Lane: donated

## Executive summary

`decodable-readers` is a Hee-Lee Oss good-deed project that authors **open, phonics-aligned decodable
storybooks** for early reading — short, illustrated texts written so a beginning reader can
**sound out almost every word** using only the letter–sound correspondences (GPCs) they have
already been taught, plus a small, pre-taught set of high-frequency "tricky" words. The books are
designed to **slot directly into the `literacy-from-zero` flagship** as the "now read a whole
story" practice tier that sits on top of letter-sound instruction, and to be usable on their own by
teachers, tutors, parents, and adult emergent readers in low-resource settings.

The defining constraint of this project — its identity — is **provable decodability**. A book that
*claims* to be decodable at a given level but actually contains words the reader cannot yet sound
out is not a neutral mistake: it silently teaches the child to **guess from pictures and context**
instead of decoding, which is the exact habit structured-literacy instruction exists to prevent. So
decodability here is treated the way `vital-info-translations` treats licensing: **encoded as
checkable data and enforced by an automated gate**. Every book is checked against a transparent,
published **scope-and-sequence** by a **decodability checker**; a book that does not provably meet
its claimed level **does not ship**. This is the project's headline gate.

The work runs in the **donated lane**: a human runs their own coding/writing agent interactively to
draft a story, illustrations brief, and metadata, then opens a PR; the Hee-Lee Oss CLI only prepares the
workspace and opens PRs. The project is **low risk tier** overall (original children's fiction over
controlled vocabulary), but it carries three care obligations that are non-negotiable and are gated
in CI/review: (1) **decodability correctness** (above); (2) **child-content safeguarding +
inclusive representation** review of every book; and (3) for any **non-English** language, a
**native-speaker literacy/linguistics reviewer**, because phonics is language-specific and a book's
decodability claim cannot be trusted across an orthography the reviewer doesn't read. The third
obligation makes non-English work *effectively medium-risk in practice* even though the project tier
is low.

Honest status note: this is a **candidate** project (per `planning/ROADMAP.md`); **no partner
literacy organization or named requesting program is yet secured.** Until one is, `verifiedNeed` is
recorded as `false` on tasks whose value depends on a named beneficiary, and the project's
Definition of Shipped (a book *actually used with real learners*) cannot be fully met. M0/M1 are
deliberately built to produce real, reusable value (the checker, the open scope-and-sequence, the
first verified books) **without** a partner; securing a first partner and confirming integration
with `literacy-from-zero` is the top open dependency (see Open questions and Roadmap M2).

## Problem & beneficiaries

**Who is helped.** The ultimate beneficiaries are **people learning to read from the very
beginning** — primarily young children, and equally the **unschooled or low-literacy adults** that
`literacy-from-zero` targets — who need to *practice decoding on connected text* but for whom no
suitable book exists. Intermediate beneficiaries are the **teachers, tutors, volunteers, and
parents** who teach them, often in **low-resource or under-served-language settings** where
commercial decodable readers are expensive, copyrighted, English-only, or simply unavailable.

**The need (category-level, well-evidenced).** Systematic phonics / structured-literacy
instruction teaches letter-sound correspondences in a deliberate order, and learners need texts
they can **actually decode at each step** to build accuracy and confidence before they meet
unrestricted text. Two gaps make this hard:
- **Most "early readers" are not decodable.** Predictable / leveled texts are written to be *guessed*
  from pictures and repeated sentence frames; using them during the phonics phase rewards guessing
  over decoding.
- **Good decodables are scarce, costly, and overwhelmingly English.** Open, freely-redistributable
  decodable sets aligned to a transparent scope-and-sequence are rare; for most of the world's
  languages they barely exist. Naively *translating* English decodables does **not** work, because
  decodability is a property of a specific language's spelling system and teaching order (see
  Non-goals).

**Verified need: TO BE SECURED.** The *category* need is strong and well-documented in the reading-
science literature and in the existence of `literacy-from-zero` as a selected flagship. But a
**specific requesting program, target learner population, language set, and the exact
scope-and-sequence it teaches to are not yet secured.** We record this honestly: foundation tasks
(checker, sequence data, first verified books) proceed without a partner; **adoption/delivery tasks
are blocked** and marked `verifiedNeed: false` until a partner and target are confirmed.

**Partner org: TO BE SECURED.** Candidate partner / distribution-channel types (none committed as
of this draft): `literacy-from-zero` itself (the most natural internal "requestor"); open-content
literacy repositories such as **StoryWeaver (Pratham Books)**, the **Global Digital Library /
Norad**, the **African Storybook initiative (Saide)**, and **Worldreader / Library For All**;
structured-literacy / "science of reading" educator communities and Decoding-Dyslexia groups; and
university education / speech-language departments for reviewer support and small effectiveness
studies.

## Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- Publish **original, openly-licensed, illustrated decodable storybooks** that **provably** match a
  **transparent, published scope-and-sequence**, level by level, cumulatively.
- Make decodability **machine-checkable**: ship a **decodability checker** + a curated, segmented
  **lexicon** + scope-and-sequence-as-data, so every book's level claim is verified, not asserted.
- Be **genuinely multilingual the right way**: each language gets its **own native
  scope-and-sequence and natively-authored books** (not translations), starting with languages
  where we have reviewer coverage.
- Make every book **accessible**: clean print/EPUB/HTML outputs, a **dyslexia-friendly** font
  option, large-print and low-ink variants, and structured text suitable for screen readers and for
  `read-aloud-audio` alignment later.
- Guarantee **safeguarding + inclusive-representation review** and (for non-English)
  **native-speaker linguistic review** of every book before it ships.
- Deliver book sets that a literacy program / partner **actually uses with real learners**, and
  that **slot into `literacy-from-zero`**.

**Non-goals**
- **Not** a phonics *curriculum* or a method war. We publish *texts aligned to* a scope-and-sequence;
  we do not prescribe how to teach, and we support **more than one** published sequence rather than
  declaring one "correct."
- **Not** predictable/leveled "guessing" readers, look-and-say sight-word primers, or generic
  picture books. (Those overlap with the separate `open-childrens-books` project.)
- **Not machine-translated decodables.** We never produce a non-English book by translating an
  English one and re-tagging it; decodability does not survive translation. Each language is authored
  natively against its own sequence. (This is the single most important non-goal.)
- **Not** an assessment, screening, or diagnostic tool, and **not** a dyslexia/clinical instrument.
  We provide practice texts; we do not test, label, or diagnose learners.
- **Not** a reading app, LMS, hosting platform, or account system. We produce open files; partners
  and existing open repos handle distribution.
- **Not** audio/narration (that is `read-aloud-audio`), handwriting practice (`handwriting-practice`),
  or original non-decodable picture books (`open-childrens-books`) — we coordinate with, but do not
  duplicate, those projects.
- **Not** content that is unsafe, frightening, or inappropriate for young children, and not content
  that stereotypes or excludes any group (enforced by the safeguarding/representation gate).

## Success metrics (outcomes)

Outcome-based and beneficiary-centric. Baselines are ~0 (new project). **Outcome** targets are for
the first ~6 months **after a partner/program is secured**; **interim foundation metrics** are
tracked from M0/M1 so progress is visible *before* a partner exists. We explicitly **do not** count
"PRs merged," "books drafted," or "words written" as success.

**Outcome metrics (post-partner)**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decodable books **adopted/used with real learners** by a program/partner | 0 | ≥ 1 full set (≥ 6 books) in ≥ 1 language | Partner written confirmation in PR/receipt |
| Languages covered **end-to-end** (sequence → verified books → used) | 0 | ≥ 2 | Project registry |
| **Integration with `literacy-from-zero`** (books referenced as its decodable practice tier) | none | linked + used in ≥ 1 lesson flow | Cross-project link + maintainer confirmation |
| Partner-reported **usefulness** of a delivered set (qualitative) | n/a | Positive from ≥ 1 program | Partner feedback log |
| **Learner decoding signal** (aspirational, partner-run, observational — *not* a Hee-Lee Oss claim) | n/a | Partner reports learners can decode the set with ≥ 90% word accuracy | Partner's own informal running-record / report |

**Interim foundation metrics (M0/M1, partner-independent)**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| Books passing the **decodability gate** (100% coverage vs claimed level) | n/a | **100%** of published books (hard gate; **automated from M1**, manual+checker in M0) | Decodability checker report per book |
| Books passing **safeguarding + representation** review | n/a | **100%** (hard gate) | Review sign-off in PR |
| Books passing the **story-quality rubric** (engagement / arc / character / age-fit) | n/a | **100%** (hard gate, human-judged, distinct from decodability) | Story-quality sign-off in `review.yaml` |
| Non-English books passing **native-speaker linguistic** review | n/a | **100%** (hard gate) | Reviewer sign-off in PR |
| **License/provenance completeness** of published artifacts (text + illustrations) | n/a | **100%** (hard gate) | License-check task / CI |
| Verified books published end-to-end (except adoption) | 0 | ≥ 1 by end of M0; ≥ 6 (a coherent set) by end of M1 | Repo + checker reports |
| Tricky-word load within policy (see below) | n/a | 100% of books within the published density cap | Checker report |
| Reviewers qualified (pedagogy / safeguarding / per-language) | 0 | ≥ 2 by end of M1 | Reviewer roster |

**Defining "decodability" precisely (so the gate is enforceable).** For a book tagged to
scope-and-sequence *S* at **level/step *k***, every running word must be **either** (a)
**decodable** — i.e., spellable using only the GPCs introduced in *S* at or before step *k*, per the
word's segmentation in the lexicon — **or** (b) a **pre-taught tricky/heart word** on *S*'s
cumulative tricky-word list at step *k*. We track two numbers:
- **Decodability coverage** = (decodable words + listed tricky words) ÷ total running words.
  **Hard gate: coverage = 100%.** *Zero* off-sequence words. (A single un-decodable, non-listed word
  fails the book.)
- **Tricky-word density** = listed tricky words ÷ total running words. **Quality cap (policy):** at
  the earliest levels, **≤ 1 *new* tricky word per book** and **≤ ~10–15% tricky words overall**
  (exact caps set per-level in the content policy). Density above the cap fails review even though
  coverage is 100%, because an over-loaded "decodable" is functionally a sight-word text.

**Honest framing vs. the industry "~80% decodable" convention (no overclaiming).** Many published
decodables and the research convention report **~80% decodability** with pre-taught tricky/heart
words filling the remainder (e.g. Geodes markets "at least 80% decodable"; CKLA claims "100%
decodable" *only when used alongside its own sequence*). Our two-number model is **stricter and more
precise, not looser**: we require **coverage = 100%** (zero off-sequence words) **and** separately
**cap tricky-word density** — so the "100%" refers to *off-sequence = 0*, not to a claim that every
word is sounded out with no tricky words. Because the tricky-word allowance does real pedagogical
work, **external messaging must not imply our books are stricter than competitors in a way the cap
contradicts**: we say "**100% on-sequence: every word is either decodable at the stated step or a
pre-taught tricky word, with tricky words capped**," never a bare "100% decodable." (See Open
questions on public messaging.)

**Sample rule for any rate reported as a percentage.** Percentages are reported only once the
denominator is **≥ 10 published books**; below that we report raw counts (e.g., "7/8 books passed")
to avoid small-sample noise.

## Scope

**Definition — "scope-and-sequence" (the contract a book is checked against).** An ordered list of
**steps**; each step declares the **GPCs introduced** at that step and the **tricky words
pre-taught** at that step. A book names exactly one sequence + step and is decodable *cumulatively*
(everything up to and including that step). We **publish the sequence as data** and support **more
than one** (English alone has several widely-used orders); we do not invent a novel sequence unless a
partner needs one. There is **no single "correct" phonics scope-and-sequence** (the field agrees only
that instruction must be *systematic, sequential, cumulative*), which is exactly why we support
multiple orders as data rather than declaring one canonical.

**M0 English sequence shortlist (named now — the lexicon, first set, and exports all depend on it).**
Strong open candidates with transparent, openly-documented orders: **UFLI Foundations** (University of
Florida — freely published scope & sequence + free decodable passages) and a **Letters-and-Sounds-
derived** order (widely documented, non-proprietary). **License reality must be verified before we
derive from any of them** — UFLI is "free to use" but lacks a clear CC reuse/derivatives grant, so the
Letters-and-Sounds-derived order is the fallback. We **avoid aligning to copyrighted commercial orders
as the primary sequence** (Fundations/Wilson, Read Write Inc.).

**Definition — "low-resource language" (for prioritization).** A target language qualifies if
**openly-licensed decodable readers aligned to a published scope-and-sequence are scarce or absent**
for it, and it has a meaningful learner population. **Reviewer availability is a hard precondition,
not a qualifier:** we only schedule a language for which a qualified native-speaker
literacy/linguistics reviewer can be sourced.

**Prioritization rule (among candidate languages/levels).** (1) a **secured partner's** stated
target language and the sequence it teaches; (2) **`literacy-from-zero`'s** launch language(s);
(3) largest learner population with the **weakest existing open decodable material**; (4) **reviewer
coverage already available**; (5) **transparent (shallow) orthographies first** as the cheapest path
to a correct second language (e.g., a language where letter→sound is highly regular), since they let
us prove the multilingual model with lower segmentation risk. Ties break toward reusing existing
lexicon/sequence work.

**In scope**
- **Scope-and-sequence data** (`sequences/<lang>/<id>.yaml`) for each supported language, sourced
  from or aligned to a transparent, openly-documented order; license/provenance recorded.
- A **curated, segmented lexicon** (`lexicon/<lang>.yaml`) giving each word's grapheme→phoneme
  segmentation so decodability is computed deterministically.
- **Original decodable storybooks**: story text, level metadata, illustration brief + open-licensed
  illustrations, computed decodability report, reviews, provenance, attribution.
- The **decodability checker** + content **JSON Schemas** + **CI gate**.
- **Accessible exports**: HTML/EPUB/print-PDF, dyslexia-friendly font option, large-print/low-ink
  variants; structured text for screen readers and future audio alignment.
- **Safeguarding + inclusive-representation policy**, **content-rating** per book, **review rubric**,
  and per-book **license/provenance verification**.

**Out of scope**
- Translating existing decodables across languages (a non-goal, see above).
- Teaching method, lesson plans, assessment/screening, or diagnosis.
- Audio narration, handwriting sheets, non-decodable picture books (sibling projects).
- A website, app, account system, or hosting platform.
- Books in a language with **no qualified reviewer** available (we do not ship unreviewed reading
  material for children).
- **Non-alphabetic/non-phonemic orthographies for v1** — abugidas (Hindi/Amharic), abjads (Arabic),
  syllabaries, and tonal orthographies don't fit a flat GPC list cleanly; v1 is **alphabetic/phonemic
  only**, with the schema designed to accommodate akshara/syllable units later (see Key decisions; an
  Open question targets which shallow-orthography language is the M2 first non-English target). *Note:*
  in shallow orthographies "decodability" is a weaker constraint (almost everything is decodable
  early), so the value-add there shifts toward **sequencing + cultural authenticity** — scope non-
  English work to where it actually helps.
- Adapting third-party stories whose **license or public-domain status is unverified or
  incompatible** (see Data, licensing & compliance).

## Competitive landscape & differentiation

The space is **crowded with *free* decodables but sparse on the specific intersection this project
targets**: *openly-licensed (CC-BY/CC0) · scope-and-sequence-mapped · machine-verified · genuinely
multilingual · illustrated* decodable sets. Existing efforts fall into three buckets — high-craft but
English-only and not openly reusable; open but not decodable/not verified; or free-but-license-murky
and unillustrated. **No one ships all five properties together.** That intersection is the gap.

**Closest analogues and where they stop short**
- **Global Digital Library (GDL — Norad/UNESCO/NDLA).** Genuinely **open** (primary licenses CC-BY /
  CC-BY-SA, commercial reuse allowed), multilingual (100+ languages), print + offline, and explicitly
  hosts "leveled and decodable, local-language" books. But it **aggregates existing content** — it
  does not author scope-and-sequence-mapped decodable *sets* and has **no decodability linter or
  guarantee**; "decodable" is a label, not a verified property. → **Natural distribution channel +
  partner, not a competitor.**
- **Bloom Library (SIL Global).** The **closest existing analogue to the multilingual ambition**:
  free OSS authoring tool + library, 10k+ books across 500–1000+ languages, with decodable+leveled
  *templates* and a shared CC art pool. But decodability is **author-asserted inside the tool, not
  externally verified**; there is no published machine checker or canonical sequence-as-data, and
  quality/consistency vary. → **Partner + art source, and the analogue we beat on verification.**
- **UFLI Foundations (Univ. of Florida).** Free, research-based, with a **published, widely-adopted,
  transparent English scope-and-sequence** and free decodable passages — the **strongest *sequence*
  source for English M0**. But it is passages (not illustrated open sets), English-only, and its
  license is "free to use" with **no clear CC reuse/derivatives grant — this must be verified before
  we derive a sequence from it** (a Letters-and-Sounds-derived, non-proprietary order is the fallback).
- **Higher-craft English decodables** — Flyleaf, Reading Universe (GBH), Geodes (Great Minds/Wilson),
  CKLA/Amplify — prove decodable-and-engaging is achievable, but are **English-only and not openly
  reusable** (CKLA's open materials are CC-BY-**NC**-SA; Geodes/Flyleaf are commercial or
  access-gated; several are tied to proprietary sequences).
- **Open multilingual storybook platforms** — African Storybook (Saide), StoryWeaver (Pratham) — have
  the **open licenses and the languages** but their books are **leveled/predictable, not decodable**
  and carry no phonics sequence or decodability control. → **Complementary partners + art/source
  feeds, not competitors.**
- *Reference check:* the prior "Open Equal Access" reference **could not be verified** as a distinct
  decodables project; it has been **replaced** by the verified open sources above (GDL, Bloom, the
  free-PDF ecosystem). Do not cite it.

**Our differentiator (the moat).** A **published, deterministic decodability linter + scope-and-
sequence-as-data + segmented lexicon** that turns "decodable" from an *editorial claim* into a
**verifiable, open guarantee** — and that the whole open ecosystem (GDL, Bloom authors, the free-PDF
world) can reuse to *certify their own content*. Reinforced by: (1) an open license that actually
**permits reuse** (CC-BY/CC0, vs. NC/access-gated rivals) with airtight provenance; (2) **multilingual
done the right way** — native sequence + native author + native reviewer + verification, which no
aggregator matches; (3) **distribution via incumbents, not against them** — publish *into* GDL/Bloom/
StoryWeaver/African Storybook as the verified, scope-mapped content+tooling layer they lack; and
(4) being the **purpose-built decodable practice tier for `literacy-from-zero`**, a use-case no
general decodable publisher serves. (Adjacent reuse of the linter is covered in *Adjacent
opportunities*.)

## Solution approach & architecture

This is primarily a **content/data pipeline** project (deliverables are books + data artifacts) with
**one focused software component** (the decodability checker + schemas). It rides existing Hee-Lee Oss
donated-lane mechanics (CLI prepares workspace, human runs agent, PR opened, human/expert review
gates "done"). Per CLAUDE.md, the checker is **project tooling living in this repo** and is
**agent-neutral** — no vendor/agent-specific logic; nothing goes into `packages/core`.

**Pipeline (per book)**
1. **Pick sequence + level** — choose the target scope-and-sequence and step *k*; this fixes the
   allowed GPCs and tricky words.
2. **Author story** — agent drafts a short, engaging, age-appropriate story constrained to the
   allowed GPCs + listed tricky words; flags any word it had to reach for.
3. **Segment new words** — any word not already in the lexicon is segmented (grapheme→phoneme) and
   added; this is the human-reviewed step that keeps the checker honest.
4. **Run the decodability checker** — compute coverage (must be 100%) and tricky-word density (must
   be within the level cap); emit `decodability.json`. Off-sequence words **block**.
5. **Illustration brief + assets** — produce an illustration brief and source/create **open-licensed
   or original** illustrations; record image provenance + license.
6. **Review** — (a) **pedagogy/decodability** reviewer confirms level fit and the checker report;
   (b) **safeguarding + representation** reviewer confirms child-appropriateness and inclusive,
   non-stereotyped content; (c) **story-quality** reviewer scores engagement/arc/character/age-fit
   against the rubric (gate-blocking, distinct from decodability); (d) for **non-English**, a
   **native-speaker linguistics/literacy** reviewer confirms the sequence, segmentation, and
   naturalness. Sign-offs recorded in `review.yaml`.
7. **License & provenance check** — text license, illustration license(s), any adapted-source
   provenance, attribution strings all present and compatible.
8. **Export** — render accessible HTML/EPUB/PDF (+ dyslexia font, large-print variants).
9. **Deliver** — hand the set to the program/partner; record **actual use** (Definition of Shipped).

**Artifacts / data model**
- `sequences/<lang>/<id>.yaml` — `{ id, language, sourceName, sourceUrl, licenseName, licenseUrl,
  steps: [ { step, gpcs: [...], trickyWords: [...] } ], notes, verifiedBy, verifiedDate }`.
- `lexicon/<lang>.yaml` — entries `{ word, sense?, pos?, segmentation: [ { grapheme, phoneme } GPC
  tuples ], syllables, notes }`; the **single source of truth** the checker uses to judge
  decodability. **Decodability is context-dependent**, so the lexicon keys each correspondence as an
  explicit **(grapheme, phoneme) tuple** and **allows multiple entries per spelling** for homographs/
  heteronyms and context-sensitive GPCs — e.g. `c`=/k/ (*cat*) vs `c`=/s/ (*city*); `g`=/g/ vs /j/;
  `-ed`=/t/,/d/,/ɪd/; `a` in *was* vs *cat*; *read* (present) vs *read* (past). A correspondence is
  "introduced" only if **that specific (grapheme, phoneme) pair** is at/before step *k* — not merely
  the letter. (`lexiconSchema` must encode this **before M0 ships** — see Key decisions and TASKS.)
- `books/<lang>/<book-id>/`:
  - `book.yaml` — `{ id, title, language, sequenceId, step, decodabilityTargetCoverage: 100,
    trickyDensityCap, ageBand, themes, contentRating, authors, illustrators,
    difficulty: { runningWordCount, sentenceLengthBand, newGpcDensity } }`. The **difficulty** block
    (running-word count, sentence-length band, new-GPC density) keeps a "set" coherent in *difficulty*,
    not just in GPC coverage — two books at the same step can differ widely in load, and partners map
    these to their own levels.
  - `text.md` — the story (UTF-8 Markdown).
  - `decodability.json` — checker output `{ coverage, trickyDensity, offSequenceWords: [...],
    newTrickyWords: [...], pass: bool }`.
  - `review.yaml` — `{ pedagogySignoff, safeguardingSignoff, storyQualitySignoff,
    linguisticSignoff (if non-EN), coiDeclarations, agentFlags, status }`.
  - `provenance.yaml` — `{ originalOrAdapted, adaptedSource?, sourceLicense?, retrievalDate?,
    sequenceVersion, lexiconVersion, authors, illustrators }`.
  - `illustrations/` — image files + `illustrations/provenance.yaml` (per-image license/source).
  - `attribution.txt` — required attributions for any adapted text and for illustrations.
- `templates/illustration-brief.md`, `templates/review-checklist.md`,
  `templates/story-quality-rubric.md`.
- `policy/content-and-representation.md`, `policy/content-rating.md`, `policy/tokenization.md`
  (the load-bearing tokenization spec — see the checker, below).

**The decodability checker (the one software component).** Input: `text.md` + `sequenceId` + `step`
+ `lexicon/<lang>.yaml`. It tokenizes the text, looks up each word's segmentation in the lexicon,
and decides for each word: **decodable** (every **(grapheme, phoneme)** correspondence in the word's
chosen segmentation was introduced ≤ step), **tricky-listed** (on cumulative tricky list ≤ step), or
**off-sequence** (fail). Words **not in the lexicon** are reported as `needs-segmentation` and
**block** until added+reviewed — the checker never guesses a segmentation, which is what keeps the
gate trustworthy. Output `decodability.json` + a non-zero exit on any off-sequence/needs-segmentation
word or density-cap breach, so **CI fails closed**.

*Context-dependent correspondences (false-pass hole — closed).* Because a grapheme's decodability
depends on *which phoneme* it maps to at this step (`c`=/k/ vs /s/, `-ed`=/t/,/d/,/ɪd/, etc.) and on
word sense (homographs/heteronyms), the checker judges against **(grapheme, phoneme) tuples**, not
bare letters, and a spelling with multiple lexicon entries (per `lexiconSchema`) is **disambiguated
by an explicit per-occurrence sense tag**; if a running token is ambiguous and untagged, the checker
**blocks it as `needs-segmentation`/`needs-disambiguation`** rather than silently picking a sense —
it never guesses. This closes the silent false-pass the risk table flags.

*Tokenization spec (load-bearing — must be pinned before the first book).* "100% coverage" is
undefined until tokenization is specified, so `policy/tokenization.md` (enforced by the checker)
fixes the handling of: **capitalization** (sentence-initial caps normalized for lookup),
**contractions** (e.g. *can't* — is the `n't` taught? scored per its GPCs/tricky listing),
**hyphenates**, **proper nouns / character names** (a classic decodable cheat — policy states whether
names must be decodable, pre-taught as tricky, or explicitly exempt-and-counted), **inflections**
(`-s`, `-ed`, `-ing`), **numerals**, and **punctuation**. The checker implements exactly this spec;
changing tokenization is a versioned change that re-validates dependent books.

**Why a curated lexicon (an honest engineering decision).** Robust automatic grapheme→phoneme
*alignment* is unreliable, especially for deep orthographies like English. Early decodables, however,
use a **small, controlled vocabulary** (low hundreds of words at the first levels), so maintaining a
hand-segmented, human-reviewed lexicon is **tractable and far more trustworthy** than auto-G2P. The
lexicon grows only as books need it. (Open pronunciation resources — e.g. public-domain CMUdict for
English — may *seed* candidate segmentations, but every entry used in a published book is
human-reviewed; see licensing.)

**LLM/Claude leverage in authoring (donated lane — candidate generation, never final authority).**
The donated lane means any Claude use is the **human's own interactive agent** during authoring (no
funded/API execution in v0.1; default model **`claude-opus-4-8`**, with `claude-fable-5` for the
highest-stakes multilingual/long-horizon work). The model adds the most leverage at exactly the
points where a deterministic check, not the model, has the final say:
- **Multi-candidate constrained story generation (highest value).** Given a step's allowed GPC set +
  tricky-word list, the agent generates **multiple** candidate short stories (return story + word
  list + the model's own flagged "reach" words as one schema-validated structured object), and **the
  linter judges all candidates** — "generate 10, lint all, a human picks the best." This turns the
  brutal constraint-satisfaction-plus-creativity problem into a search the deterministic gate scores.
- **Illustration *briefs*, not images.** Draft per-page illustration briefs (scene, characters, mood,
  cultural cues, accessibility notes) for human artists / open-art search — **briefs only**; the
  AI-generated-image policy stays off-by-default (see Licensing).
- **Lexicon seeding + within-level leveling.** Propose **CMUdict-seeded** candidate (grapheme,phoneme)
  segmentations for new words (English), and propose sentence-length bands / running-word counts /
  the step a draft actually fits — all **human-verified**, never auto-accepted.
- **Reviewer-support tooling.** Summarize a draft's flagged words and surface possible cultural/age
  concerns *for human attention*.

**Hard guardrails (the project's integrity — the LLM never decides these):** decodability is decided
**only** by the deterministic lexicon-backed linter (an LLM "thinks this is decodable" is exactly the
false-pass hole); lexicon segmentations are **human-reviewed, never auto-accepted** (checker blocks on
`needs-segmentation`); **pedagogy + cultural-appropriateness** are expert/native-reviewer gated (model
fluency is not a substitute and must not gate a non-English book); **story quality is human-judged**
(the model does not score its own output for the gate); **no unreviewed child-facing content ever
ships**; and per CLAUDE.md **no secrets/keys** in logs or receipts (applies to any funded-lane
metering if ever introduced — see Open questions).

**Content schemas & CI validation.** The Task JSON schema lives in `packages/schema/src/schemas.ts`
(AJV / JSON Schema **draft-07**). This project's content artifacts get their **own JSON Schemas in
the same place** — `sequenceSchema`, `lexiconSchema`, `bookSchema`, `decodabilityReportSchema`,
`reviewSchema`, `provenanceSchema` — compiled and exposed via `validate.ts` exactly like
`taskSchema`/`registrySchema`. A structural-check script wired into `pnpm test` **fails CI** on any
malformed artifact; the decodability checker and license check run in the same CI job so a book
cannot merge with a failing level claim or missing attribution.

**Formats & accessibility.** UTF-8 throughout; Markdown canonical for text; YAML for metadata; JSON
for machine reports. Exports: semantic HTML, EPUB 3 (reflowable, screen-reader friendly), print PDF,
plus a **dyslexia-friendly font** option and **large-print / low-ink** variants. The font option uses
a **specific open-licensed face (default OpenDyslexic, under its open license)** and is framed as a
**reader *option*, not an evidence-based intervention** (dyslexia-font efficacy is contested in
research); coordinate with the sibling `open-accessible-fonts` project. Structured text is kept clean
so `read-aloud-audio` can align narration later.

**Key decisions**
- **Decodability-as-data, enforced by a fail-closed gate** — the project's core discipline.
- **Correspondences keyed as (grapheme, phoneme) tuples, with a pinned tokenization spec** — closes
  the context-dependent false-pass hole (`c`=/k/ vs /s/, contractions, proper nouns) before M0 ships.
- **Curated segmented lexicon over auto-G2P** — trust over coverage.
- **Story quality is a separate, gate-blocking, human-judged rubric** — "checker-passed" is necessary
  but not sufficient; a correct-but-lifeless book does not ship.
- **v1 orthography scope is alphabetic/phonemic, declared explicitly**, with the schema designed to
  later accommodate abugidas/abjads/syllabaries/tone so non-English M2 doesn't hit a data-model wall.
- **Multiple published sequences supported; none declared "correct"** — avoids method wars and
  maximizes reuse across programs.
- **Native authoring per language, never translation** — preserves decodability.
- **Originals by default; adaptation only from verified PD/open sources** — minimizes license risk.
- **The linter is the moat: published as a standalone, versioned tool (+ MCP server)** so the open
  ecosystem can certify its own content (see Adjacent opportunities).
- **Accessibility and `literacy-from-zero` integration are first-class**, not afterthoughts.

## Data, licensing & compliance

**This is a critical section. Be conservative; when rights or child-appropriateness are unclear, do
not publish.**

**Text content.**
- **Originals by default.** Stories are **authored originally** for this project and released under
  an open license (default **CC-BY-4.0**; **CC0** offered where a partner/repo prefers public-domain
  dedication for maximum reuse). Original authorship is the cleanest path and the default.
- **Adaptation only from verified sources.** If a story adapts an existing work (e.g., a folktale),
  the source must be **confirmed public-domain or openly-licensed**, with provenance recorded
  (source, edition/version, retrieval date, license name + URL + a **snapshot/hash** of the license
  text). PD status is **jurisdiction-dependent** and must be verified, not assumed; ambiguous status →
  do not adapt. Coordinate with `world-folktales-open` / `public-domain-translations` where relevant.

**Illustrations (a distinct rights surface — handled explicitly).**
- Illustrations are **original (commissioned/contributed) or sourced from openly-licensed / PD image
  collections**, with **per-image** license + source recorded in `illustrations/provenance.yaml` and
  attributed in `attribution.txt`. Share-alike and attribution terms are honored.
- **AI-generated illustration policy (explicit decision required):** because the copyright/licensing
  status of AI-generated images is **legally unsettled and varies by jurisdiction**, AI-generated
  illustrations are **off by default**; if ever used they must be **labeled as such**, carry a clear
  usage statement, and be approved by the maintainer per the content policy. Default path is original
  or openly-licensed human art. (This is an open question for governance — see Open questions.)

**Scope-and-sequence & lexicon data.**
- A scope-and-sequence may be **aligned to** a published order; we record the source and its license.
  Where an order is a copyrighted commercial program, we **do not copy it**; we either use an openly-
  documented order or author/derive a sequence with reviewer sign-off and record that provenance.
- Lexicon segmentations are **factual linguistic data** authored/reviewed by us; where seeded from an
  open resource (e.g., **CMUdict**, U.S. public domain) the seeding source is recorded. Output
  lexicon/sequence data is released **CC-BY-4.0** (or **CC0** on request).

**Output licensing summary.** Project **code/tooling: MIT**. **Books, sequences, lexicons,
templates: CC-BY-4.0 by default (CC0 where preferred)**. Adapted text and all illustrations carry
their **source-compatible** license + required attribution; if a source forbids derivatives or
relicensing, we do not use it.

**Privacy / PII — minimal by design.** Content is **fiction for children**. We ingest **no personal
data**, collect **no learner data**, and store **no images of real identifiable people** unless
explicitly PD/consented and reviewed. No analytics on learners. Partner contacts are handled
out-of-band and never committed. Per CLAUDE.md, **no secrets/tokens/keys** in logs, receipts, or
committed files.

**Provenance model.** Every book ships `provenance.yaml` linking it to its sequence version, lexicon
version, original-or-adapted status (+ source license if adapted), authors, illustrators, and image
provenance. Provenance is **part of the license gate** — incomplete provenance blocks shipping.

## Quality, review & risk gates

**Risk tier: low** (original children's fiction over a controlled vocabulary). **But three hard gates
apply to every book, and non-English work is treated with medium-risk rigor in practice** because its
correctness depends on a reviewer who reads the language.

**Required review before a book is "done"**
1. **Decodability gate (automated + human).** The decodability checker reports **100% coverage** and
   **tricky density within the level cap**, with **zero** off-sequence / needs-segmentation words; a
   **pedagogy/decodability reviewer** confirms the level fit and that any new lexicon segmentations
   are correct. *Fail → not shipped.*
2. **Safeguarding + inclusive-representation gate (human).** A reviewer confirms the book is
   age-appropriate, non-frightening, free of unsafe modeling, and **inclusive/non-stereotyped**
   (gender, race/ethnicity, disability, family structure, religion, region), with a content rating
   recorded. *Fail → not shipped.*
3. **Story-quality gate (human, gate-blocking, distinct from decodability).** A reviewer scores the
   book against `templates/story-quality-rubric.md` — **engagement, narrative arc, character, and
   age-fit** — because the tricky-density cap only prevents sight-word overload, not lifelessness. A
   "checker-passed" book that is correct but dull (the perennial decodable failure mode, e.g. "the fat
   cat sat on a mat") **fails this gate**. The reviewer is human; the LLM does **not** score its own
   output for this gate. *Fail → not shipped.* (May be combined with, but is recorded separately from,
   the pedagogy sign-off.)
4. **Linguistic gate (human, non-English only).** A **native-speaker literacy/linguistics reviewer**
   confirms the scope-and-sequence, the lexicon segmentations, and that the language is natural and
   correct. *No qualified reviewer → the language is not shipped.*
5. **License & provenance gate (automated + human).** Text + illustration + adapted-source licenses,
   attributions, and provenance are present and compatible. *Fail → not shipped.*
6. **CI green** for the checker, schema structural checks, and any tooling code; **maintainer
   approval** of the PR.

**Reviewer independence & two-reviewer rule.** Reviewers must be **independent of the drafting
step**: the human who ran the authoring agent may **not** be the sole reviewer for that book, and
each reviewer records a **conflict-of-interest declaration**. The **decodability** and
**safeguarding** sign-offs must be by **different people** (a single person may not clear both for the
same book). For **non-English** books the **linguistic** reviewer is **mandatory and independent**.

**Disagreement / conflict resolution.** If reviewers disagree, the book **cannot be signed off**
until resolved: (1) reconcile against the sequence, lexicon, and content policy, recording the
rationale; (2) unresolved issues escalate to the **maintainer** (or a third reviewer); (3) **when in
doubt, the more conservative reading wins** — a contested word is replaced and a contested
safeguarding concern is removed/softened rather than shipped. Resolution is recorded in `review.yaml`.

**Agent uncertainty self-check (operationalized).** The authoring agent must emit explicit flags —
`UNCERTAIN: <location> | <type: off-sequence|segmentation|age-appropriateness|cultural|adapted-source>
| <note>` — for any word it had to reach for, any new segmentation it is unsure of, and any content it
is unsure is appropriate. Flags are copied into `review.yaml` as `agentFlags`; **no sign-off may be
recorded while any flag is unresolved** (each must be `resolved` or `accepted-as-is` with reasoning).

**Definition of Shipped (project-specific).** A book/set is *shipped* only when: acceptance criteria
met **and** the **decodability gate** passes (100% coverage, density within cap) **and**
**safeguarding/representation** sign-off recorded **and** **story-quality** sign-off recorded **and**
(non-English) **linguistic** sign-off recorded **and** **license/provenance** verified **and** CI
green **and** the set is **delivered to a
program/partner and actually used with real learners** (or adopted as the decodable practice tier in
`literacy-from-zero`). **Merged-but-unused is not shipped.**

## Roadmap & milestones

**M0 — Foundation & cold-start (no partner required).**
Goal: stand up the decodability machinery + policies and prove the pipeline on **one** English book
end-to-end except adoption.
Exit criteria: one **scope-and-sequence published as data** (English, from an openly-documented
order, license recorded); **lexicon schema + seed entries** for the first levels; the
**decodability checker** + content JSON Schemas working and runnable locally; **review rubric**
(decodability + safeguarding/representation) and **content + representation + content-rating policy**
merged; **license/provenance policy** (incl. illustration + AI-image stance) merged; **one original
English decodable book** authored, **checker-passed (100% coverage, density within cap)**, with
**pedagogy + safeguarding** sign-off and a passing license/provenance check; an **illustration brief
+ at least one open-licensed/original illustration** with recorded provenance. `verifiedNeed`
honestly `false` (no partner). *License/decodability gate note:* M0 runs the checker + a **minimal
automated structural check** (schemas + presence of required metadata/attribution) so the "100%"
gates are honest from day one; **full CI enforcement is automated in M1**.
*Correctness prerequisites added in v0.2 (must land in M0, before the first book):* `lexiconSchema`
encodes **(grapheme, phoneme) tuples with multiple entries per spelling**; a **tokenization spec**
(`policy/tokenization.md`) is published and implemented by the checker; a **gate-blocking story-quality
rubric** (`templates/story-quality-rubric.md`) is merged; the **M0 English sequence is chosen from the
named shortlist with its reuse license verified** (UFLI / Letters-and-Sounds-derived); **v1 orthography
scope (alphabetic/phonemic) is declared**; the accessibility font option names a **specific open face
(OpenDyslexic)**.

**M1 — A coherent set + repeatability (no partner required).**
Goal: prove this scales to a *teachable set*, not a one-off.
Exit criteria: a **coherent set of ≥ 6 English books** covering the first N steps cumulatively, every
book checker-passed and reviewed; **decodability + schema + license checks enforced in CI**
(fail-closed); **accessible export pipeline** (HTML/EPUB/PDF + dyslexia font + large-print) producing
all set books; **reviewer qualification criteria** published + **≥ 2 qualified reviewers** engaged
(pedagogy + safeguarding); **authoring runbook** merged. Dependency: reviewer sourcing.
*Added in v0.2:* **difficulty metadata** (`book.yaml` running-word count / sentence-length band /
new-GPC density) makes the set coherent in *difficulty*, not just GPC coverage; an **illustration
supply strategy** (shared CC art pools — African Storybook, Bloom shell-book art, Openverse/Wikimedia
— + a contributor-artist pipeline + a consistent-style guide) is in place **before** book count
scales (the likely real M1 bottleneck); and **book production is capped until ≥ 1 partner conversation
is serious** (the M1 pause/decision point), so we don't author sets no program has committed to use.

**M2 — Multilingual foundations + first partner (needs partner / reviewer).**
Goal: prove the multilingual model **the right way** and deliver an adopted set.
Exit criteria: a **second language's native scope-and-sequence + lexicon** authored with
**native-speaker linguistic review** (prefer a transparent orthography first); a **native-authored
set in that language** (not translated), checker-passed and fully reviewed; **partner/program secured
(`verifiedNeed = true`)** and target language/sequence agreed; **integration with
`literacy-from-zero` confirmed** (books referenced as its decodable practice tier); **≥ 1 set
delivered and confirmed used with real learners** (first true Definition-of-Shipped event).
Dependency: M0/M1 + partner + per-language reviewer.

**M3 — Scale & sustain.**
Goal: scale languages/levels with sustained quality and tracked outcomes.
Exit criteria: ≥ 2 languages with multi-level sets in use; **publication to open repos**
(e.g. StoryWeaver / Global Digital Library) with correct attribution; **reviewer rotation**
established; **outcome tracking** (usage, partner feedback, any defects) operating; named
**sustainability owner**; documented **maintenance cadence** for sequences/lexicons.
*Added in v0.2 (the reuse flywheel):* the **decodability checker is published as a standalone,
documented, versioned tool + an MCP server** so GDL/Bloom/free-PDF-ecosystem authors can certify their
own content against our sequences-as-data — turning our gate into the field's standard and a
distribution flywheel (see Adjacent opportunities).

## Work breakdown

The itemized, sized backlog lives in **[TASKS.md](./TASKS.md)**, organized by the milestones above
(M0–M3) plus a Backlog/future section. Each task maps to a Hee-Lee Oss Task JSON (schema in
`packages/schema/src/schemas.ts`) with id, type, lane, risk tier, deliverable, acceptance criteria,
and license fields. M0/M1 tasks are partner-independent foundations; M2+ tasks are gated on a secured
partner / per-language reviewer and are marked `verifiedNeed: false` until then.

## Governance, roles & stakeholders

- **Maintainer (Owner): J. Carter (acting)** — assigned now; accepts/sequences tasks, approves PRs,
  owns the scope-and-sequence + lexicon integrity, the decodability gate, and the license/provenance
  gate. Acts as interim license/compliance reviewer until a dedicated reviewer is named.
- **Pedagogy / decodability reviewers: TO BE SECURED** — structured-literacy-literate reviewers
  (teacher, reading specialist, or SLP) who confirm level fit + lexicon segmentation. Rotation
  defined in M1.
- **Story-quality reviewer (gate-blocking): TO BE SECURED** — scores engagement/arc/character/age-fit
  against the rubric, independent of the drafter; may be the same person as the pedagogy reviewer but
  records a **separate** sign-off. A book that is decodability-correct but lifeless does not ship.
- **Safeguarding / inclusive-representation reviewers: TO BE SECURED** — confirm child-appropriate,
  inclusive, non-stereotyped content + content rating; **independent** of the decodability reviewer.
- **Native-speaker linguistic reviewers (per non-English language): TO BE SECURED** — **mandatory**
  for any non-English book; a language with no reviewer is not shipped.
- **Steward (last-mile owner): TBD — named by end of M1** (acting maintainer holds these duties
  meanwhile). Owns the partner/`literacy-from-zero` relationship and confirms **actual use**
  (without which nothing reaches "shipped"). Naming a steward is a **prerequisite for entering M2**.
- **Partner / requestor: TO BE SECURED** — literacy program / `literacy-from-zero` / open repo that
  defines target language + sequence and confirms use.
- **Expert reviewers** — for any drift toward assessment/diagnosis or clinical dyslexia claims (which
  are out of scope), a credentialed expert is required (and the item should be rejected as
  out-of-scope instead).

## Dependencies & integrations

- **Hee-Lee Oss donated lane**: `packages/cli` (workspace prep + PR), `packages/core`, `packages/schema`
  (Task JSON + this project's content schemas). No funded-lane / API-key execution.
- **`literacy-from-zero`** (sibling flagship) — the primary internal consumer/integration target;
  this project supplies its decodable practice tier.
- **Sibling projects** — `read-aloud-audio` (future narration alignment), `open-childrens-books`
  (non-decodable picture books; coordinate to avoid overlap), `open-accessible-fonts`
  (dyslexia/under-served-script fonts), `world-folktales-open` / `public-domain-translations`
  (verified source material for adaptation).
- **Open scope-and-sequence references** and **open pronunciation resources** (e.g. PD CMUdict for
  English seeding) — used under their licenses; every used entry human-reviewed.
- **Open content repos / distribution channels** — StoryWeaver (Pratham Books), Global Digital
  Library/Norad, African Storybook (Saide), Worldreader/Library For All — **external, not yet
  secured**; targets for partner + publication.
- **Human reviewers** (pedagogy, safeguarding, per-language linguistics) — **external dependency, not
  yet secured.**

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A book labeled decodable isn't (off-sequence words) → teaches guessing, harms learners | Medium | High | Fail-closed decodability checker (100% coverage gate); curated reviewed lexicon (no guessed segmentations); pedagogy reviewer confirms; CI fails on any off-sequence word | Maintainer / Pedagogy reviewers |
| Wrong/auto segmentation makes the checker lie (false "pass") | Medium | High | Checker never guesses — unknown words **block** as `needs-segmentation`; every used segmentation human-reviewed; non-EN linguistic reviewer mandatory | Pedagogy / Linguistic reviewers |
| Context-dependent GPC / tokenization gap → silent false-pass (`c`=/k/ vs /s/, contractions, proper nouns) | Medium | High | Lexicon keys **(grapheme, phoneme) tuples** with multiple entries per spelling; published **tokenization spec** enforced by the checker; ambiguous untagged tokens **block** | Maintainer / Pedagogy reviewers |
| "Checker-passed" but lifeless story (the perennial decodable failure mode) | Medium | Medium | **Gate-blocking, human-judged story-quality rubric** (engagement/arc/character/age-fit), separate from decodability; story-quality sign-off required to ship | Pedagogy / Story-quality reviewers |
| Naive translation of English books breaks decodability in other languages | Medium | High | Hard non-goal; each language authored natively against its own sequence; per-language reviewer gate | Maintainer / Linguistic reviewers |
| Inappropriate, frightening, or stereotyped content reaches children | Low | High | Mandatory independent safeguarding/representation gate + content-rating policy + reviewer checklist; conservative-reading-wins rule | Safeguarding reviewers |
| Illustration/source license violation (esp. images, adapted folktales, AI-image ambiguity) | Medium | High | Originals by default; per-image + per-source provenance/license recorded + checked; AI-images off by default & labeled; "if unclear, don't use" | License reviewer / Maintainer |
| No partner / program secured → nothing reaches "shipped" | High | Medium | M0/M1 build partner-independent value; concrete outreach plan (Open questions) incl. `literacy-from-zero` as the natural first requestor; `verifiedNeed=false` until secured; pause/decision point if none by end of M1 | Acting maintainer → Steward |
| No qualified reviewer for a target language | High | High | Reviewer availability is a hard precondition; don't ship unreviewed; partner with literacy orgs / universities; transparent orthographies first | Steward / Maintainer |
| Method-war / "wrong sequence" disputes stall the project | Medium | Medium | Support multiple published sequences as data; don't declare one "correct"; align to a partner's sequence when one exists | Maintainer |
| Scope creep into assessment/diagnosis/curriculum | Medium | Medium | Explicit non-goals; reject such tasks; require expert + likely out-of-scope | Maintainer |
| Lexicon/sequence quality erodes as it grows | Medium | Medium | Schemas + CI structural checks; review on every new entry; maintenance cadence (M3) | Maintainer |
| Single-person dependence (acting maintainer wears many hats) | Medium | Medium | Reviewer roster + rotation (M1/M3); name Steward before M2; document runbook | Maintainer |

## Security & privacy

- **Threat surface is small**: public, original text + images in a public repo. Main risks are
  **integrity** (a book that fails its decodability claim; an inappropriate-content slip) and
  **license/provenance**, not data exfiltration.
- **No secrets** in the normal flow (donated lane uses the human's own agent; no API keys/escrow).
  Per CLAUDE.md, never write secrets/tokens into logs, receipts, or committed files.
- **PII: none.** No learner data, no analytics, no images of real identifiable people (unless
  explicitly PD/consented + reviewed). Partner contacts kept out-of-band, uncommitted.
- **Child-safety as security.** The safeguarding gate is treated as a release-blocking control, not a
  style note; the content + representation policy is the spec it's checked against.
- **Abuse/misuse prevention.** Refusal guardrails apply: refuse content that is unsafe for children,
  discriminatory/stereotyping, deceptive, or that violates a source license/privacy. Reject any
  attempt to repurpose the checker or texts for harmful ends.
- **Supply-chain / integrity.** Pin sequence + lexicon versions in each book's provenance; hash/
  snapshot any adapted-source license; CI validates all content artifacts; reproducible exports.

## Sustainability & maintenance

- **After delivery**, the maintainer + steward keep sequences and lexicons current, re-verify any
  adapted-source licenses, and re-run the checker if a sequence changes (a sequence edit can change
  *every* dependent book's decodability — so changes are versioned and trigger re-validation).
- **Outcome tracking** continues post-delivery: a usage/feedback log per delivered set, partner
  check-ins on continued use, and a defect log (e.g., a slipped off-sequence word found in the field).
  Outcomes (use, learner decoding signal, defects) — not merge counts — are the maintained metrics.
- **Reviewer rotation** (M1/M3) avoids single-person dependence; **Steward** owns the last mile.
- **Decommissioning / correction.** If an adapted source's license changes or a quality defect is
  found, provenance makes impact assessment possible; affected books are corrected, re-checked, or
  withdrawn and downstream repos notified.

## Adjacent opportunities

These are **forward-looking spin-offs**, not v0.2 commitments; they are recorded so the architecture
stays reuse-ready (several are seeded in the Roadmap / Backlog).

- **A shared `decodability-engine` (highest-leverage).** Extract the checker + sequence schema +
  lexicon format into a **standalone open library/CLI** used across the literacy portfolio — by
  `literacy-from-zero` (verify its own practice texts), by `open-childrens-books` (to *tag* which of
  its books happen to be decodable at which level), and by external platforms (GDL/Bloom/free-PDF
  authors) to certify content. This is the single most reusable artifact the project produces.
- **An MCP server exposing the engine.** Tools such as `check_decodability(text, sequenceId, step)`,
  `list_allowed_gpcs(sequenceId, step)`, `segment_word(word) → candidate (human-review-required)`,
  and `suggest_in_vocab_synonyms(word, step)` let *any* agent author against the constraint
  interactively and verify deterministically — "decodability as a service" as a public good. The
  linter stays **deterministic server-side**; the model never gets the pass/fail verdict.
- **`literacy-from-zero` integration (the flagship tie).** Books become its "now read a whole story"
  tier and the engine verifies that tier; formalize the data contract (which sequence, which steps)
  early — this is the project's primary outcome path.
- **`read-aloud-audio` alignment.** Decodable texts (small, controlled vocabulary) are an ideal first
  corpus for word-level audio alignment; the plan already keeps clean structured text for this.
- **`open-pronunciation-audio`.** Per-GPC and per-tricky-word pronunciation audio keyed to the
  sequence supports both the lexicon (audio reference for segmentations) and learners, reusing the
  sequence-as-data spine.
- **`world-folktales-open` / `public-domain-translations` (source feed).** Verified-PD folktales
  become *adaptation* candidates for higher-level decodables (where vocab constraints loosen), under
  the licensing discipline already specified.
- **A "certify your decodable" badge (ecosystem play).** Let the open community run their books
  through the engine and earn a verifiable "decodable at sequence X, step k" provenance stamp —
  driving adoption of our sequences-as-data as the lingua franca.

## Open questions

1. **Partner / first requestor.** Which program or repo is the first to *use* a set? **Outreach plan
   (concrete):**
   - **Targets (named):** `literacy-from-zero` (internal, most natural first requestor); StoryWeaver
     (Pratham Books), Global Digital Library/Norad, African Storybook (Saide), Worldreader / Library
     For All; structured-literacy educator communities; university education/SLP departments.
   - **Owner:** acting maintainer until a Steward is named (by end of M1), who then takes it over.
   - **Timeline:** outreach begins in parallel with M0; aim for **≥ 3 serious conversations by end of
     M1** and an **agreed first partner/integration during M2**.
   - **Pause/decision point:** if **no partner/integration is secured by end of M1**, the maintainer
     makes an explicit **go / pivot / hold** decision (e.g., ship the open set + checker as a
     standalone public good and integrate into `literacy-from-zero` directly) rather than authoring
     more books no program has committed to use.
2. **Which scope-and-sequence(s)?** Adopt one openly-documented English order for M0; which? And do we
   support a second English order before going multilingual, or go to a second language first?
   (Default: prove the set in one English order, then a transparent second language.)
3. **Second language choice.** Which transparent-orthography language gives the best
   need × reviewer-availability for M2?
4. **AI-generated illustrations.** Governance decision on the policy (default: off, labeled if ever
   used). Who decides per book?
5. **Lexicon seeding.** Use PD CMUdict (English) to *seed* candidate segmentations (all human-
   reviewed), or hand-author from scratch? (Default: seed-then-review for speed, never auto-accept.)
6. **Effectiveness evidence.** Can a university partner run a small observational study on decoding
   accuracy/confidence? (Aspirational; not a Hee-Lee Oss-made claim without it.)
7. **Funded lane?** Project is donated; is there ever a case for metered authoring under escrow for a
   surge of partner-requested levels? (Out of scope for v0.1; would require `fundedBudgetUsd` and the
   same gates + a hard per-task budget cap.)
8. **Context-dependent GPC disambiguation in running text.** The lexicon now keys (grapheme, phoneme)
   tuples with per-sense entries; how does the checker disambiguate a homograph/heteronym at a given
   occurrence — POS tagging, human per-occurrence sense tags, or block-and-review? (Default:
   human/explicit sense tag; ambiguous-and-untagged tokens **block**, never auto-pick. *Blocks
   correctness of the headline gate.*)
9. **Tokenization & proper-noun policy.** Are character names required to be decodable, pre-taught as
   tricky, or explicitly exempt-and-counted? How exactly are contractions, inflections, and numerals
   scored? (Must be pinned in `policy/tokenization.md` **before the first book**.)
10. **Sequence licensing reality.** Is **UFLI Foundations'** order actually reusable/derivable under
    an open license, or only "free to use"? Verify (don't assume) before deriving; same for any
    candidate order. Fallback: a Letters-and-Sounds-derived non-proprietary order.
11. **"100% on-sequence" vs the industry "~80% decodable" convention — public messaging.** How do we
    state our stricter coverage gate without overclaiming relative to Geodes/CKLA, given that the
    tricky-word allowance does real pedagogical work? (See Success metrics framing note.)
12. **Story-quality gate ownership.** Who scores the story-quality rubric, and is it truly
    gate-blocking and independent of the drafter? (Plan: yes, gate-blocking; reviewer assignment TBD.)
13. **Non-alphabetic orthographies & the M2 target.** v1 is alphabetic/phonemic; which shallow-
    orthography language (need × reviewer availability) is the first non-English target, and when is
    the schema extended for abugidas/abjads/syllabaries/tone?
14. **Engine-as-product.** Is the checker/MCP server resourced as a **first-class standalone
    deliverable** (`decodability-engine`, the biggest reuse lever) or kept as in-repo tooling?

## Appendix A — Improvements applied

The following 25 specific improvements were identified against an initial draft and **applied** in
the plan and tasks above (this is not a wish-list — each is reflected in the text).

1. **Made decodability machine-enforceable, not asserted.** Defined a **decodability checker** that
   fails closed in CI, instead of relying on author claims. (Solution approach; gates.)
2. **Defined "decodability" with two precise numbers** — 100% **coverage** (hard gate) + a
   **tricky-word density cap** (quality gate) — so the gate is unambiguous and testable. (Metrics.)
3. **Made the checker refuse to guess.** Unknown words **block** as `needs-segmentation` rather than
   being auto-segmented, closing the "false pass" hole. (Checker design; risks.)
4. **Chose a curated, reviewed lexicon over auto-G2P**, with an honest rationale (auto-alignment is
   unreliable for English; early vocab is small). (Solution approach.)
5. **Elevated the "no machine translation" rule to a headline non-goal**, with the linguistic reason
   (decodability is language-specific). (Non-goals; risks.)
6. **Added a mandatory, independent safeguarding + inclusive-representation gate** with a content
   policy and per-book content rating — child-safety treated as a release control. (Gates; security.)
7. **Added a mandatory native-speaker linguistic gate for all non-English books**, and stated no
   reviewer ⇒ language not shipped. (Gates; scope.)
8. **Enforced reviewer independence** (drafting human ≠ sole reviewer; decodability ≠ safeguarding
   sign-off by same person) with COI declarations. (Gates.)
9. **Treated illustrations as a separate rights surface** with per-image provenance/license, not
   lumped with text. (Licensing.)
10. **Added an explicit AI-generated-illustration policy** (off by default, labeled, governance
    decision) given unsettled image-copyright law. (Licensing; open questions.)
11. **Made `verifiedNeed=false` honest throughout** and marked partner/requestor **TO BE SECURED**,
    matching the schema and the real candidate status. (Status note; tasks.)
12. **Named `literacy-from-zero` as the natural first internal requestor** and made integration with
    it a tracked outcome + M2 exit criterion. (Beneficiaries; metrics; roadmap.)
13. **Replaced vanity metrics with outcomes** (books *used with learners*, languages end-to-end) and
    added partner-independent **interim foundation metrics** so progress is visible pre-partner.
14. **Added a sample-size rule** (no percentages below 10 books) to avoid small-sample noise. (Metrics.)
15. **Supported multiple published scope-and-sequences** instead of declaring one correct, defusing
    method-war risk. (Non-goals; key decisions; risks.)
16. **Versioned sequences/lexicons and made a sequence edit trigger re-validation** of dependent
    books — a real footgun made explicit. (Sustainability; risks.)
17. **Operationalized the agent uncertainty self-check** with a concrete `UNCERTAIN:` flag format
    that blocks sign-off until resolved. (Gates.)
18. **Added a concrete partner-outreach plan with owner, timeline, and a pause/decision point** if no
    partner by end of M1. (Open questions; risks.)
19. **Phased multilingual deliberately** — transparent (shallow) orthographies first as the
    lowest-risk path to a correct second language. (Scope prioritization; roadmap M2.)
20. **Made accessibility first-class** — EPUB/HTML/PDF, dyslexia font, large-print/low-ink, clean
    structured text for future audio alignment. (Goals; solution approach.)
21. **Drew explicit boundaries with sibling projects** (`open-childrens-books`, `read-aloud-audio`,
    `open-accessible-fonts`, `world-folktales-open`) to prevent duplication. (Non-goals; deps.)
22. **Defined output licensing precisely** — MIT code; CC-BY-4.0 (CC0 optional) content; source-
    compatible for adapted/illustration material. (Licensing.)
23. **Kept PII surface at zero** explicitly (no learner data, no analytics, no real-person images).
    (Privacy.)
24. **Added a fail-closed CI gate uniting** decodability + schema + license checks, phased (manual+
    checker in M0 → automated CI in M1) so the 100% gates are honest from day one. (Roadmap; tasks.)
25. **Added a correction/decommissioning path** (defect log, withdraw/notify downstream) for issues
    found in the field, plus reviewer rotation to remove single-person dependence. (Sustainability.)

## Review sign-off

**Reviewed against the PLAN_SPEC robustness bar and Hee-Lee Oss guardrails on 2026-06-28.**

- **Structure & depth:** all 17 required H2 sections present and in order; depth matches the
  exemplars (Ofelia product-vision clarity + vital-info license/gate rigor). ✔
- **Measurable metrics:** outcome + interim tables carry baseline, target, and a measurement method;
  decodability is defined as two enforceable numbers; a sample-size rule prevents small-sample noise. ✔
- **Enforceable gates:** four hard gates (decodability, safeguarding/representation, non-English
  linguistic, license/provenance) are fail-closed and tied to Definition of Shipped; CI enforcement
  phased M0→M1. ✔
- **Risks:** table has Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation, **and a named Owner** for every row;
  highest-severity rows (false-decodable, bad segmentation, child-content, license) all mitigated. ✔
- **Guardrails:** license/provenance is conservative (originals default; verify PD/open; per-image
  rights; AI-image stance); **PII = none**; child-safeguarding is a release control; non-English work
  gated on a native reviewer; refusal guardrails referenced. ✔
- **Honesty:** project is correctly stated as a **candidate** with **no partner**; `verifiedNeed`
  is `false` on partner-dependent tasks; partner/requestor marked **TO BE SECURED**. ✔
- **Sequencing:** M0 thin cold-start (one verified book) → M1 coherent set + CI enforcement →
  M2 multilingual + partner + `literacy-from-zero` integration → M3 scale/sustain; dependencies are
  explicit and realistic. ✔
- **Schema validity:** TASKS.md maps every field of `taskSchema`; the example Task JSON was checked
  against the draft-07 schema (all required fields present, enums valid, `verifiedNeed=false`, real
  `outputLicense`). ✔

**Issues found & fixed during review:** (a) tightened the metric denominator/sample rule; (b) made
the sequence-edit re-validation footgun explicit in Sustainability and Risks; (c) added the
independence rule that decodability and safeguarding sign-offs must be different people; (d) ensured
the M0 license/decodability gate is honest (checker + structural check now, full CI in M1).
**No blocking issues remain.** Items needing a **human decision** before execution: choose the M0
English scope-and-sequence; ratify the AI-illustration policy; secure the first partner / confirm
`literacy-from-zero` integration; source pedagogy/safeguarding/linguistic reviewers.

## Changelog — v0.2 (analysis merged)

Merged the findings of `COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md` (analyst review of v0.1, web research 2026-06-29)
into this plan. Changes are **surgical and additive**; structure, guardrails, vision, and valid v0.1
content are preserved. No facts were invented.

**Correctness fixes applied (the two most material findings + supporting fixes):**
- **Closed the context-dependent-GPC false-pass hole.** The lexicon now keys correspondences as
  explicit **(grapheme, phoneme) tuples** and **allows multiple entries per spelling** for
  homographs/heteronyms (`c`=/k/ vs /s/, `g`=/g/ vs /j/, `-ed`=/t/,/d/,/ɪd/, *read* present/past).
  A correspondence counts as introduced only if *that specific pair* is at/before the step. Updated
  the data model, checker spec, Key decisions, and Risks. (`lexiconSchema` must encode this before M0.)
- **Pinned a tokenization spec** (`policy/tokenization.md`, checker-enforced) for capitals,
  contractions, hyphenates, **proper nouns / character names**, inflections, numerals, punctuation —
  "100% coverage" is undefined without it. Ambiguous untagged tokens **block**, never auto-pick.
- **Added a gate-blocking, human-judged story-quality rubric** (engagement/arc/character/age-fit),
  explicitly distinct from decodability, with its own sign-off in `review.yaml`, a gate (#3), a metric
  row, a Risk row, a reviewer role, a template, and inclusion in the Definition of Shipped.
- **Reconciled "100% decodability" with the industry ~80% convention** in Success metrics — clarified
  that our "100%" means *off-sequence = 0* with separately-capped tricky words (stricter, not looser),
  and added an anti-overclaiming messaging rule (+ an open question).
- **Replaced the unverifiable "Open Equal Access" reference** with verified open sources (GDL, Bloom,
  the free-PDF ecosystem); flagged it as not-to-be-cited in References.

**Strategy integrated:**
- **New "## Competitive landscape & differentiation"** section: GDL (open+multilingual, no
  verification), Bloom/SIL (closest analogue, author-asserted decodability), UFLI Foundations (best
  English sequence source, license to verify), higher-craft English rivals (not openly reusable);
  differentiator = a **published deterministic decodability linter + sequence-as-data + segmented
  lexicon** turning "decodable" from claim into a verifiable open guarantee, distributing *via*
  incumbents.
- **Folded "Claude API leverage" into the architecture** (donated-lane authoring subsection):
  multi-candidate constrained story generation judged by the linter; illustration **briefs, not
  images**; **CMUdict-seeded** segmentation candidates + within-level leveling — all human-verified —
  with hard guardrails that the **LLM never decides decodability, pedagogy, cultural-appropriateness,
  or story quality** and never ships unreviewed child-facing content (default `claude-opus-4-8`,
  `claude-fable-5` for highest-stakes).
- **Folded the optimizations into the Roadmap:** M0 now requires the GPC-tuple lexicon schema,
  tokenization spec, story-quality rubric, named+license-verified sequence shortlist (UFLI /
  Letters-and-Sounds-derived), declared alphabetic/phonemic v1 orthography scope, and a named open
  dyslexia font (OpenDyslexic, framed as an option). M1 adds **difficulty metadata** to `book.yaml`,
  an **illustration-supply strategy**, and a **book-production cap until a partner conversation is
  serious**. M3 publishes the checker as a **standalone tool + MCP server**.
- **New "## Adjacent opportunities"** section: a shared **`decodability-engine`** (reusable by
  `literacy-from-zero`, `open-childrens-books`, external platforms), an **MCP server**, audio/
  pronunciation/folktale spin-offs, and a "certify your decodable" badge.
- **Merged Open questions** (added GPC disambiguation, tokenization/proper-noun policy, UFLI license
  reality, 100%-vs-80% messaging, story-quality ownership, non-alphabetic orthographies + M2 target,
  engine-as-product resourcing) and added the verified competitive sources to References.

**Preserved:** all v0.1 H2 sections and order; open-license / structured-literacy-evidence /
multilingual-orthography / cultural-appropriateness / accessibility guardrails (strengthened, never
weakened); honesty posture (`verifiedNeed=false`, partner TO BE SECURED); Appendix A and the v0.1
review sign-off. TASKS.md received matching surgical edits.
